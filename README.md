# Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

## Compilation and Running
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

## Origin and History
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
### Goals in creation of Java Language
1.  It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
2.  It must be robust and secure.
3.  It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
4.  It must execute with high performance.
5.  It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.
